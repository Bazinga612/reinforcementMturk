INSERT INTO slot4 VALUES (366, "I think the repeat time lines are the most effective. Like the episode of Supernatural,  or even groundhogs day. They give a chance to learn ,  with no lasting consequence.", 5);

INSERT INTO slot4 VALUES (504, "That sand on your feet is good for exfoliating your feet!", 4);
INSERT INTO slot4 VALUES (97, "What I do like is nature documentaries. Those are pretty wholesome and the kids seem to find them interesting enough to sit still through,  plus we learn things.", 2);

INSERT INTO slot4 VALUES (9, "Books have a larger scope to show a story in though. They have as much or as little time as they need,  no constraints on budgets when it comes to a fantasy world or effects.
